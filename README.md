# e621-batch-downloader
A single, simple, out of the box python file to mass download e621 images.

The only requirement is Python 3.

To use, simply create a file called "tags.txt" and type in a single line, the tags as you would type them in e621.
Now run e621.py

This will create a folder with the pictures and a file called files.dat.
files.dat keeps a record of downloaded images to save time in future uses. Delete this file for a clean run.
